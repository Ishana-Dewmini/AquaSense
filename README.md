# AquaSense
EN2160_EDR_Individual_Project-Water_Level_Indicator.

AquaSense is a smart water level indicator designed to monitor and display the water level in a tank automatically. 
The user can set upper and lower threshold values, and when they exceeded, an integrated buzzer, OLED screen, and LED provide visible and audible alerts. 
Moreover, the device sends real-time notifications to the user's smartphone, allowing remote monitoring via a mobile application. 
To conserve power, users can manually deactivate the display and buzzer while maintaining a connection to the app. A
quaSense not only ensures efficient water management but also offers a user-friendly interface, empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their water resources.

## Functionality
### 1. Normal mode
- Users can monitor the tank water level through both the device screen and the Blynk IOT mobile application.
- Users can change the full tank distance (Distance from the sensor to the water level when the tank is filled) and the empty tank distance (Distance from the sensor to the bottom of the tank) through the mobile app.
- When the water level is below 10% of the full tank level or above 95% of the full tank level user receives alerts through the mobile app, the device screen, the buzzer, and the RED LED.
- Users can continuously monitor the tank water level through both the mobile app and the device screen.
- The buzzer and the LED will turn off automatically when the water level is once again in between two threshold values.
- Users can manually turn off the buzzer when it rings. This can be done in two ways.1. Only turn off the buzzer until the water level exceeds the other threshold.2. Turn off the buzzer completely.

### 2. Power Conservation Mode
- Users can completely turn off the OLED and the buzzer if they are not used and monitor the water level only through the mobile application.

### 3. Connectionless-Mode
-Users can monitor the water level only through the device screen without connecting two WIFI.
